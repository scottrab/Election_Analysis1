#Election Audit Analysis

#Purpose  
The purpose of the election audit was to determine the total votes, the winner of the election, and several statistics breaking down the percentage of votes for    each candidate, as well as the raw number of votes received. In addition, the election audit provides statistics on county turnout and provides the percentage of votes for each county in the election as well as listing the county with the highest turnout of voters. Finally, the election audit provides detailed statistics of the winner of the election, the number of votes the winner recieved and the percentage of votes.

#Election Audit Summary
The election results above were a result of a script written using Python 3.7 and this script, with a few adjustments, could be used to determine the winner of any election.  One way the script could be modified would be to add the percentage of votes each candidate recieved from each county.  This would be a useful statistic to know for a candidates campaign in order to target the right areas.  Another adjustment that could be made to the script would be to add more comments about the code so that it is even more readable for anyone to read and understand.
